# Prop-suite
This is a platform where clients can check for available property(apartment) postings, contact the sellers, then review the sellers after a transaction. The app's original theme both in design and functionality is built to mimic [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com), so users also have to option to follow other users. The app is mobile-responsive.

## Features

The app has two levels of authorization;
- A regular client can
    - view public documents on the website(apartments, agents' reviews, followers).
    - signup for an account to be able to use the service.
    - search for an apartment by address, category, price.

- A user has all the privileges of a regular client and can also perform the following actions:
    - Log in to use their account.
    - Add a new apartment posting with multiple photos.
    - review a seller after a transaction.
    - follow other users.
    - update their profiles including avatar and coverphoto uploads.
    - Log out of their account.
    - Delete their account.

## Technologies
- The application was developed with [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/).
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) for database management.
- All apartment, user avatar and coverphoto images are hosted on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/).
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and pure CSS for styling.
- [Stimulus Js](https://stimulusjs.org/) for adding functional responsiveness(click events management).
- [Webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker) for managing javascript assets.
- [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for CI.
- [Rubocop](https://rubocop.org/) to ensure ruby developer best practices.
- [Rspec](https://rspec.info/) and [Capybara](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara) for UI, unit and integration tests.

## Installation
Follow the steps below to setup a local development environment. First ensure you have [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) installed, and a version of [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) equal to or greater than v5.2.3 .

1. Clone the repository from a terminal 
    ```git clone https://github.com/codecell/prop-suite```.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
    ```cd prop-suite```
3. Install project dependencies.
    ```bundle install```
4. Run the migrations to setup the tables.
    ```rails db:migrate```
5. Start the rails server.
    ```rails server```
6. Visit localhost:3000 and Voila!!!.

- ## Cloudinary setup
    All image uploads are hosted on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/), so ensure to register for an account(registration is free).
    - After registration copy your cloud-name, api-secret and api-key into config/application.yml, I left a sample in config/application_sample.yml.
    - Please do not expose your cloudinary credentials to the public so ensure to place the config/application.yml into the .gitignore file.
